<p>~~~</p>

v0.31

<b>[Fixes/patches]</b><br/>
Fixed bug where you could only post in one topic<br/>
Disabled links inside app to stop it breaking if you accidentally click a link<br/>
Post datetime is actually real now as opposed to being xx/xx/xx<br/>
Using the next/prev page buttons in a topic will put you at the top of the new page after it's loaded rather than putting you at the top of the current page and then loading the new page<br/>

<b>[Enhancements]</b><br/>
Pressing "last page" will put you to the bottom of the page and thus the last post<br/>
Made topic control buttons larger<br/>
Decreased tap response time so that tapping feels overall more responsive<br/>
Added version number to login page<br/>
Changed name of app to "mobilue" over "mobiLUE"
