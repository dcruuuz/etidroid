ETI android app

This is for bug tracking right now only

The latest apk can be found at the link I PM'd you.


<p>=====================================================</p>
v0.31

[Fixes/patches]<br/>
Fixed bug where you could only post in one topic<br/>
Disabled links inside app to stop it breaking if you accidentally click a link<br/>
Post datetime is actually real now as opposed to being xx/xx/xx<br/>
Navigating through a topic will put you at the top of a page after it's loaded rather than putting you at the top of the current page and then loading the new page<br/>

[Enhancements]<br/>
Pressing "last page" will put you to the bottom of the page and thus the last post<br/>
Made topic control buttons larger<br/>
Decreased tap response time so that tapping feels overall more responsive<br/>
Added version number to login page<br/>
Changed name of app to "mobilue" over "mobiLUE"
