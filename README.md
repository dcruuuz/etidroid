ETI android app

This is for bug tracking right now only

The latest apk can be found at the link I PM'd you.



v0.31

Fixed bug where you could only post in one topic
Made topic control buttons larger
Post datetime is actually real now as opposed to being xx/xx/xx
Decreased tap response time so that tapping feels overall more responsive
